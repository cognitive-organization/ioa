  content: "High-risk churn signals (riskLevel >= 0.7) are most effectively handled with a 4-step workflow: classify → analyze → offer → deliver. Offering retention incentives within 2 hours of signal detection yields 3.2x better retention than delayed response. The fan-out pattern (parallel financial + user impact analysis) reduced total workflow time by 40%."
  summary: "Churn response within 2h yields 3.2x better retention; fan-out pattern cuts workflow time 40%"
