  id: "DEC-002"
  status: accepted
  domain: product
  date: "2026-01-20"
  deciders:
    - CEO
    - CTO
    - Product Lead
  context: "We need to define clear domain boundaries to avoid overlapping responsibilities and ensure each domain has explicit data ownership and event contracts."
  options:
    - name: "Functional boundaries"
      description: "Split by business function: product, growth, analytics"
      pros:
        - Clear ownership
        - Aligns with team structure
        - Natural event boundaries
      cons:
        - May create silos
        - Cross-functional features need coordination
    - name: "Product-line boundaries"
      description: "Split by product/service offering"
      pros:
        - End-to-end ownership
        - Independent scaling
      cons:
        - Duplicated capabilities across lines
        - Harder to share data
  chosen: "Functional boundaries"
  rationale: "At our current scale, functional boundaries provide the clearest ownership model. Each domain maps to a team with distinct KPIs. Cross-domain coordination happens through explicit event contracts."
  kpiImpact:
    - kpi: feature-velocity
      expected: "Clearer ownership reduces coordination overhead"
  reversibility: moderate
