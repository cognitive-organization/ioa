  id: "DEC-001"
  status: accepted
  domain: product
  date: "2026-01-15"
  deciders:
    - CTO
    - Product Lead
  context: "We need to standardize how AI agents are designed, deployed, and governed across the organization. Without a framework, each team builds agents differently, creating inconsistency and governance gaps."
  options:
    - name: "Ad-hoc implementation"
      description: "Each team builds and manages agents independently"
      pros:
        - Maximum flexibility per team
        - No framework learning curve
      cons:
        - No standardization
        - Governance gaps
        - Duplicated effort
    - name: "IOA doctrine"
      description: "Adopt IOA as the organizational intelligence standard"
      pros:
        - Standardized resource model
        - Built-in governance and validation
        - Cross-domain consistency
        - Community-backed evolution
      cons:
        - Initial adoption effort
        - Framework constraints
  chosen: "IOA doctrine"
  rationale: "IOA provides the standardization we need without being overly prescriptive. The K8s-style resource model is familiar to our engineering team, and built-in validation catches configuration errors early."
  kpiImpact:
    - kpi: feature-velocity
      expected: "+20% through standardized agent patterns"
    - kpi: time-to-market
      expected: "-30% for new agent deployments"
  reversibility: moderate
