# IOA Doctrine v0.1 "Foundation"

## Applied Organizational Intelligence — A Principled Framework

Organizations are no longer purely human systems. AI agents now draft strategies, triage incidents, generate reports, interact with customers, and make operational decisions alongside human teams. This is not a future scenario -- it is the present reality for a growing number of companies. Yet most organizations adopt AI the way they adopted spreadsheets in the 1990s: ad hoc, unstructured, and without architectural intent.

The result is predictable. Agents proliferate without clear ownership. Decisions are made by models with no audit trail. Organizational knowledge stays trapped in prompt histories and chat logs. Teams duplicate effort because no one mapped which agent owns which domain. Governance is an afterthought, bolted on after the first incident rather than designed from the start.

**IOA -- Applied Organizational Intelligence -- exists to solve this problem.**

IOA is an open standard for designing organizations that operate with AI agents as first-class participants. It is not a product, a SaaS platform, or a consulting framework. It is doctrine: a set of principles and executable specifications that any organization can adopt, adapt, and extend.

### Design Philosophy

IOA draws its inspiration from systems architecture, not productivity tools. Think Kubernetes, not Notion. Where Kubernetes gave the industry a declarative, resource-oriented model for infrastructure, IOA provides a declarative, resource-oriented model for organizations. Every domain, agent, decision, and event is a structured resource with an API version, a kind, metadata, and a spec. This is not accidental. Declarative models enable automation, validation, composition, and evolution -- exactly the properties that AI-augmented organizations need.

### What IOA Is

- **A doctrine**: 12 principles that define what a well-designed AI-native organization looks like.
- **An executable specification**: JSON Schemas, YAML resource definitions, and CLI tooling that turn principles into enforceable structure.
- **An open standard**: No vendor lock-in. No proprietary formats. Fork it, extend it, contribute back.

### What IOA Is Not

- A replacement for human judgment. Humans remain the ultimate authority (see Principle 9).
- A prescriptive org chart. IOA defines constraints and interfaces, not reporting lines.
- A finished product. Version 0.1 "Foundation" is the starting point. The architecture is designed to evolve (see Principle 12).

### The Twelve Principles

The foundation of IOA rests on twelve principles, each addressing a critical dimension of AI-native organization design. They range from structural concerns (domain boundaries, agent topology) to operational concerns (telemetry, feedback loops) to governance concerns (human override, audit trails). Together, they form a coherent system: no principle stands alone, and each reinforces the others.

These principles are numbered for reference, not ranked by importance. An organization may adopt them incrementally, but the full value emerges when they operate as a whole.
