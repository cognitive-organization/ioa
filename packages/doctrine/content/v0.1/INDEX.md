> 12 Principles for Designing AI-Native Organizations

## Preamble

- [00 — Preamble](./00-preamble.md) — Why IOA exists and what it aims to achieve.

## The Twelve Principles

| # | Principle | Description |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | [Domain-First Architecture](./01-domain-first-architecture.md) | Organization design starts with domain boundaries, not team hierarchies. |
| 2 | [Agent Topology](./02-agent-topology.md) | Every AI agent has an explicit type, bounded purpose, and clear domain binding. |
| 3 | [Decision Architecture](./03-decision-architecture.md) | Decisions are first-class resources with documented rationale and lifecycle tracking. |
| 4 | [Event-Driven Telemetry](./04-event-driven-telemetry.md) | All organizational signals flow as structured, namespaced events tied to metrics. |
| 5 | [Governance by Design](./05-governance-by-design.md) | Access control, audit trails, and failure modes are designed upfront, not bolted on. |
| 6 | [Cognitive Load Distribution](./06-cognitive-load-distribution.md) | AI agents reduce cognitive burden by handling routine work so humans focus on novelty. |
| 7 | [Memory and Context](./07-memory-and-context.md) | Organizational knowledge is explicit, versioned, and queryable across sessions and agents. |
| 8 | [Feedback Loops](./08-feedback-loops.md) | Every process has built-in feedback mechanisms that drive structured improvement. |
| 9 | [Human Override Principle](./09-human-override-principle.md) | Humans can override any AI decision at any time through explicit, tested paths. |
| 10 | [Composability](./10-composability.md) | Domains, agents, decisions, and events are composable building blocks for complex behavior. |
| 11 | [Observability First](./11-observability-first.md) | All agent actions, decisions, and events are observable by default. |
| 12 | [Evolutionary Architecture](./12-evolutionary-architecture.md) | The architecture supports gradual change with versioning built in at every level. |
