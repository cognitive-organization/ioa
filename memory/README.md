# Paribali Holding — Organizational Memory

This directory contains the holding-level memory of Paribali, maintained by IOA Core agents.

## Structure

- `decisions/` — Monthly decision ledger (DEC-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN format)
- `patterns/` — Reusable patterns extracted from cross-project experience
- `failures/` — Post-mortem archive and failure patterns

## Rules

- Only IOA holding-level agents write here
- Domain-level decisions stay in domain repos
- Monthly files: `{YYYY-MM}.md`
- Never delete entries — append only
