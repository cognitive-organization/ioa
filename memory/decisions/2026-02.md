# Decision Ledger — February 2026

### DEC-2026-02-27-001

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** All (Paribali Holding)
- **Decision:** Restructure from distributed mini-holdings to centralized IOA brain
- **Context:** Each project (CreatorCopilot, Finanfix, IOA) had independently created portfolio managers, strategy advisors, finance controllers — violating the IOA doctrine's own hierarchy principle. 59 agents across 3 repos for 0 customers.
- **Alternatives:** (1) Keep distributed agents, (2) Centralize in IOA, (3) Create separate holding repo
- **Chosen:** Option 2 — IOA as single holding brain
- **Rationale:** IOA is the meta-layer by design. Creating a separate holding repo adds unnecessary complexity. Centralizing in IOA dogfoods the standard.
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima) + Agent (Claude Code)
- **Source:** Conversation directive "FOUNDATION REALIGNMENT — PARIBALI HOLDING AI-NATIVE"

### DEC-2026-02-27-002

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** All (Paribali Holding)
- **Decision:** Reduce from 59 agents to 22 (63% reduction)
- **Context:** Over-engineering detected. 18-22 agents per project for products with zero users. Estimated $98/mo in AI costs with zero ROI. Multiple anti-patterns from IOA's own playbook: Budget Ostrich, Telemetry Desert, Decision Black Hole, Agent Spaghetti.
- **Alternatives:** (1) Keep all agents, (2) Gradual reduction, (3) Aggressive cut to minimum viable
- **Chosen:** Option 3 — Cut to 4 holding agents + 4-6 domain agents per project
- **Rationale:** Complexity only accepted if it generates clarity. 59 agents generated confusion, not intelligence.
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima) + Agent (Claude Code)
- **Source:** commit 9a75e20 (CreatorCopilot cleanup), 397114a (Finanfix cleanup), 63d9127 (IOA Core)
- **Review date:** 2026-03-29

### DEC-2026-02-27-003

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** Paribali Holding
- **Decision:** Focus allocation — Finanfix 70%, CREAOS 10%, IOA 20%
- **Context:** First Executive Cockpit run revealed Finanfix has 19 commits, green CI, near-customer-ready state. CREAOS has 20/20 failing workflow runs and zero users. IOA brain just launched.
- **Alternatives:** Equal split, or CREAOS-heavy (more features needed)
- **Chosen:** Finanfix 70% — first paying customer is the only thing that matters
- **Rationale:** Pre-revenue-critical. No growth work until PMF is validated with real money.
- **Made by:** Agent (Executive Cockpit, first run)
- **Source:** GitHub Actions run 22497027285
- **Review date:** 2026-03-06

### DEC-2026-02-27-004

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** CREAOS (paribali-labs/creator-copilot)
- **Decision:** Pivot CREAOS infrastructure from self-hosted VPS/Docker to managed services (Vercel + Railway + Neon + Upstash)
- **Context:** Self-hosted deployment required operational overhead (Caddy, Docker Compose, VPS management) that was not justified for a zero-user product; managed services reduce ops burden and match team size.
- **Alternatives:** Keep VPS/Docker self-hosted (documented as fallback), partial migration
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima) — inferred from commit scope
- **Source:** commit 756785b (paribali-labs/creator-copilot)
- **Review date:** 2026-03-29

### DEC-2026-02-27-005

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** CREAOS (paribali-labs/creator-copilot)
- **Decision:** Change primary domain from creaos.com.br to creaos.ai
- **Context:** creaos.ai better signals the AI-native product identity and international positioning; registered on GoDaddy and applied across all config, manifests, and store descriptions.
- **Alternatives:** Keep creaos.com.br (Brazil-local), use both in parallel
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima)
- **Source:** commit f5145aa (paribali-labs/creator-copilot)
- **Review date:** 2026-03-29

### DEC-2026-02-27-006

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** FINANFIX (paribali-labs/finanfix)
- **Decision:** Choose Twilio as the WhatsApp notification provider
- **Context:** FINANFIX needs WhatsApp as a primary engagement channel for Brazilian SMB users; Twilio sandbox tested successfully with credentials stored in Vercel.
- **Alternatives:** Not documented
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima)
- **Source:** issue #67 comment (paribali-labs/finanfix)
- **Review date:** 2026-03-29

### DEC-2026-02-27-007

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** FINANFIX (paribali-labs/finanfix)
- **Decision:** Use Supabase Auth Providers for Google OAuth integration
- **Context:** Google OAuth required for user acquisition; Supabase Auth was already the auth layer, so using its built-in OAuth providers avoids adding a separate auth service. Privacy policy and terms pages added per Google consent screen requirements.
- **Alternatives:** NextAuth.js, custom OAuth implementation
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima)
- **Source:** issue #13 comment (paribali-labs/finanfix)
- **Review date:** 2026-03-29

### DEC-2026-02-27-008

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** FINANFIX (paribali-labs/finanfix)
- **Decision:** Require admin approval for all outbound WhatsApp messages before delivery
- **Context:** Automated crons (onboarding nudge, churn detector, weekly check-in) could inadvertently send unsolicited messages to users; safety gate ensures human review before any Twilio message is dispatched.
- **Alternatives:** Send automatically after cron, add rate-limit only
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima) — inferred from explicit safety architecture in commit
- **Source:** commit 66e3daa (paribali-labs/finanfix)
- **Review date:** 2026-03-29

### DEC-2026-02-27-009

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** FINANFIX (paribali-labs/finanfix)
- **Decision:** Build Intelligence Dashboard with three specialist AI modules (Tax Advisor, Accountant, Financial Planner) backed by a unified `/api/v1/intelligence` endpoint
- **Context:** /insights page was a generic dashboard; redesign as specialist intelligence layer differentiates Finanfix from simple expense trackers and directly addresses the Brazilian MEI/Simples Nacional complexity.
- **Alternatives:** Single generic AI module, third-party financial advisory API
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima) — inferred from feature scope
- **Source:** commit 92f20b4 (paribali-labs/finanfix)
- **Review date:** 2026-03-29

### DEC-2026-02-27-010

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** IOA (cognitive-organization/ioa)
- **Decision:** Explicitly add Write tool to allowedTools for all holding agents in Claude Code Action workflows
- **Context:** Claude Code Action sandbox blocks the Write tool by default; holding agents (Executive Cockpit, Portfolio Manager, Focus Guardian, Decision Ledger) all need Write to save report files for artifact upload and Slack delivery.
- **Alternatives:** Use Bash echo redirect instead of Write, restructure agents to not write files
- **Made by:** Agent (inferred from fix commit pattern after workflow failure)
- **Source:** commit a6e2d1b (cognitive-organization/ioa)
- **Review date:** 2026-03-29
