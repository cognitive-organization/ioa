# Decision Ledger — February 2026

### DEC-2026-02-27-001

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** All (Paribali Holding)
- **Decision:** Restructure from distributed mini-holdings to centralized IOA brain
- **Context:** Each project (CreatorCopilot, Finanfix, IOA) had independently created portfolio managers, strategy advisors, finance controllers — violating the IOA doctrine's own hierarchy principle. 59 agents across 3 repos for 0 customers.
- **Alternatives:** (1) Keep distributed agents, (2) Centralize in IOA, (3) Create separate holding repo
- **Chosen:** Option 2 — IOA as single holding brain
- **Rationale:** IOA is the meta-layer by design. Creating a separate holding repo adds unnecessary complexity. Centralizing in IOA dogfoods the standard.
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima) + Agent (Claude Code)
- **Source:** Conversation directive "FOUNDATION REALIGNMENT — PARIBALI HOLDING AI-NATIVE"

### DEC-2026-02-27-002

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** All (Paribali Holding)
- **Decision:** Reduce from 59 agents to 22 (63% reduction)
- **Context:** Over-engineering detected. 18-22 agents per project for products with zero users. Estimated $98/mo in AI costs with zero ROI. Multiple anti-patterns from IOA's own playbook: Budget Ostrich, Telemetry Desert, Decision Black Hole, Agent Spaghetti.
- **Alternatives:** (1) Keep all agents, (2) Gradual reduction, (3) Aggressive cut to minimum viable
- **Chosen:** Option 3 — Cut to 4 holding agents + 4-6 domain agents per project
- **Rationale:** Complexity only accepted if it generates clarity. 59 agents generated confusion, not intelligence.
- **Made by:** Human (Paulo Lima) + Agent (Claude Code)
- **Source:** commit 9a75e20 (CreatorCopilot cleanup), 397114a (Finanfix cleanup), 63d9127 (IOA Core)

### DEC-2026-02-27-003

- **Date:** 2026-02-27
- **Project:** Paribali Holding
- **Decision:** Focus allocation — Finanfix 70%, CREAOS 10%, IOA 20%
- **Context:** First Executive Cockpit run revealed Finanfix has 19 commits, green CI, near-customer-ready state. CREAOS has 20/20 failing workflow runs and zero users. IOA brain just launched.
- **Alternatives:** Equal split, or CREAOS-heavy (more features needed)
- **Chosen:** Finanfix 70% — first paying customer is the only thing that matters
- **Rationale:** Pre-revenue-critical. No growth work until PMF is validated with real money.
- **Made by:** Agent (Executive Cockpit, first run)
- **Source:** GitHub Actions run 22497027285
